Just a repo to practice Javascript.

### pool-game
A simple pool game written in vanilla JS from this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXwCrtAo4Wc&t=2032s), and the [original repo](https://github.com/henshmi/Classic-Pool-Game).

Mostly to practice vanilla Javascript skills and get some exposure and practice to draw and animation methods.
